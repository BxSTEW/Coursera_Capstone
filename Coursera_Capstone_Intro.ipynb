    "With COVID-19 throwing the economic world into a frenzy many small businesses, and large corporate ones for that matter, have either filed for bankruptcy or closed their doors for good. Unfortunate as this is, up and coming entrepreneurs will face an unprecedented market of corporate real estate for new businesses. Restaurants, Bars/Pubs, Cafes, etc will have an opportunity to open in prime areas for foot traffic and income when the world returns to normalcy or creates a new normalcy after the COVID-19 threat has subsided. Analysis on neighborhoods and current establishments to find an ideal storefront will become ever important in the coming months and  years. This data will be invaluable to new start-ups and can assist them in getting the right patronage and make sure that their business income will be consistent. It will take the guess work out of where to open a business. "

    "As an entrepreneur my client has expressed interest in the New York City(NYC) area for his new craft beer pub and lounge, but he wants to pick the right neighborhood for this establishment. With that problem we can assess the things required for his business venture, he will need a middle to upper class neighborhood or borough and an area where there are few other establishments like his but not completely devoid of other establishments. He would like a list of potential neighborhoods for his new start up that fit his criteria so he can start looking for open corporate real estate."

    "I was able to procure the median household income for each borough and neighborhood in NYC from https://www.renthop.com/study/assets/new-york-city-cost-of-living-2017/nyc-2br-median-rent-and-income-table.html. I will then gather the longitude and latitude of each neighborhood. From there I will run a KMeans test to group like neighborhoods and look for those that fit the household income requirements set by the client (60K+). A new dataset will be created to only include the neighborhoods that fit the middle to upper class household incomes. Then the Foursquare API will be utilized to find the current percentages of venues in the neighborhoods that seem the most promising and from there analyze which neighborhoods would be ideal for my client. The API will provide the information regarding the top business types in each neighborhood which will allow me to figure out where a craft beer pub and lounge would be best suited to get the right consistent patronage. For instance, the Upper West Side of Manhattan has a median income of ~92K making it an ideal neighborhood based on that variable, but after some analysis the top two establishments in the neighborhood are wine bars and bars making the share of the bar market very small for my client which would disqualify it from being considered."
